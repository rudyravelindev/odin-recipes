    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe for rice and beans is so delicious! I have adapted it from the
      traditional Haitian style of making rice and beans. The scent and taste of
      the cloves make the dish! Serve with avocado on the side and you'll want
      it every night of the week!
